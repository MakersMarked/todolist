Todo list with multiple projects;

I tried to create this entire application using only JS. So for the HTML creation, I created modules rendering the pages through JS which I realize is not maintainable for a legit project. Either way, it helped me grasp the possibilities within JS.

After finished the majority of this project, I took a look at other submissions code, and I realize I need to improve on delegating methods in specific objects, and making those methods reusable.
